### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**TMann1011/TMann1011** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning GitHub and continuing to learn Python, SQL, and R on my own during school breaks to get better and faster.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning analytics in school and will graduate in May.
 - I one day want to research data to see if healthcare-for-all in the U.S. is a feasible option. I was in the hospital with Diverticulitus, and had to pay over $6000
  - out of my own pocket, so you can see why I am passionate about this. Hopefully I can work on it in my free time after I graduate!
